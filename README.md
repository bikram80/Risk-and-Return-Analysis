# ðŸ“‹ Risk-and-Return-Analysis
Risk and Return Analysis is a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook project that focuses on evaluating the risk and return characteristics of financial assets. This analysis covers the calculation of key financial metrics, including expected returns, variance, standard deviation, and correlation between assets.

# ðŸŒŸ Features and Usage

Portfolio Analysis: Calculate expected returns for individual assets and the entire portfolio.

Risk Metrics: Assess variance and standard deviation to understand asset risk levels.

Correlation Analysis: Evaluate relationships between different financial assets to identify diversification opportunities.

Data Visualization: Includes graphical representations of risk-return profiles and asset correlations for better insights.

# ðŸ’» Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical computations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.

# Results
The notebook provides detailed insights into:

The expected return of individual assets and the portfolio.

Risk assessment through variance and standard deviation calculations.

Visualizations that help interpret the risk-return profile of the assets.
