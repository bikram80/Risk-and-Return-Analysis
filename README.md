# Risk-and-Return-Analysis
Risk and Return Analysis is a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook project that focuses on evaluating the risk and return characteristics of financial assets. This analysis covers the calculation of key financial metrics, including expected returns, variance, standard deviation, and correlation between assets.

# Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Risk_Return.ipynb) that provides a comprehensive analysis of risk and return for financial assets. The notebook includes methods for calculating key financial metrics, such as expected return, variance, and standard deviation, along with visualizations to aid in the interpretation of results.

# Features
Portfolio Analysis: Calculation of expected returns and risk metrics for a given portfolio of financial assets.

Risk Metrics: Evaluation of key risk measures, including variance and standard deviation.

Correlation Analysis: Assessment of the relationships between different financial assets.

Data Visualization: Includes plots and graphs to illustrate risk-return trade-offs and correlations.

# Results
The notebook provides detailed insights into:

The expected return of individual assets and the portfolio.

Risk assessment through variance and standard deviation calculations.

Visualizations that help interpret the risk-return profile of the assets.
